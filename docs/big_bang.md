## Hindsight
- summary: `In the recent scored window, the lab repeated dead-end candidates 2 times; similar proposal shapes should cool down sooner.`
- adjustment: `Increase cooldown penalties for mechanisms with repeated dead_end outcomes.`
- adjustment: `Raise priority for proposals that directly target transfer stability after an audit_blocked result.`

## Policy
- summary: `After 787 candidates, the lab requested peer review because `repeated_audit_blocked` fired. Current policy mode is `stabilize`.`
- selection_mode: `stabilize`
- cooldown_multiplier: `2.0`
- preferred_runner_backend: `command`
- publish_every_cycles: `2`
- novelty_cycle_priority: `normal`

## Budget
- summary: `Mechanisms science_loss, science_train, initial_harness exhausted their follow-up budget; broaden the search.`
- exploration_mode: `force_broad_exploration`
- tracked_mechanisms: `13`

## Backend
- summary: `The repo-native science backend is available through the command runner with a realistic wall-clock training budget.`
- preferred_backend: `command`
- available_backends: `command, simulated`
- command_backend_configured: `True`

## Backend Science
- summary: `Recent backend evolution is concentrated in science_backend (679 candidate(s), avg transfer gap 0.035086).`
- recommended_action: `wait`
- target_module: `science_loss`
- problem: `Improve transfer-stability evaluation or smoke tests so promising candidates fail earlier before full audit.`
- why_this_module: `Recent failures are boundary-transfer specific, so the loss surface is the best next bounded module to adjust. Secondary signal: VRAM headroom is present, but it is not the main reason for this recommendation. Hold off on broad mutation until the post-change sample is less thin. Small conservative lever nudges are still allowed. The last structural change could not be identified, so recent-signal gating is conservative.`
- secondary_context: `Recent real-backend runs are only using about 676.4 MB on average, leaving most VRAM unused. The last structural change could not be identified, so recent-signal gating is conservative.`
- scored_candidates_since_change: `0`
- last_structural_commit: `-`

### Code Context
- summary: `Backend code context maps the five modular science seams to their key functions, bounded lever surfaces, fixed implementation surfaces, and likely failure-mode touchpoints.`
- target_file: `src/harness_lab/science_loss.py`
- target_purpose: `Combines classification, parameter, boundary, and instance-separation losses into the training objective.`
- key_functions: `compute_instance_loss, compute_loss`
- levered_surfaces: `param_loss_weight, boundary_loss_weight, instance_loss_weight, instance_margin`
- fixed_surfaces: `Cross-entropy plus smooth-L1 plus BCE loss recipe; Instance similarity and same-class negative construction; Loss-term composition order`

### Failure-To-Code Hints
- `boundary_smoke:gap_too_wide` -> `science_eval, science_loss, science_model`: `Boundary smoke regressions often reflect a mix of strict smoke-gap thresholds, weak boundary pressure in the loss, or insufficient boundary-sensitive representation capacity.`
- `hard_transfer_regression` -> `science_loss, science_model, science_config`: `Hard-transfer failures usually point to brittle transfer-sensitive structure, insufficient representation robustness, or seed defaults that underweight difficult cases.`
- `transfer_smoke:gap_too_wide` -> `science_eval, science_model`: `A wide benchmark-to-smoke gap is often governed by smoke gate strictness and by whether the model capacity generalizes beyond the local benchmark slice.`

### Code Change Brief
- decision_state: `wait`
- decision_reason: `Recent evidence may still be too thin or too noisy for broad mutation, but conservative lever nudges are still allowed while more scored candidates accumulate.`
- target_file: `src/harness_lab/science_loss.py`
- target_functions: `compute_instance_loss, compute_loss`
- proposed_change: `Increase transfer-sensitive boundary or instance pressure modestly, for example by strengthening boundary_loss_weight or instance_margin, without changing eval thresholds.`
- wait_option: `Recent evidence may still be too thin or too noisy for broad mutation, but conservative lever nudges are still allowed while more scored candidates accumulate.`

### Code Change Gate
- summary: `Machine-enforced scope and verification gate for the current code-change brief.`
- recommended_action: `wait`
- target_file: `src/harness_lab/science_loss.py`
- max_changed_files: `2`
- allowed_write_files: `src/harness_lab/science_loss.py, tests/test_science_loss.py`
- focused_tests: `tests/test_science_loss.py`
- verification_status: `No verification run recorded yet.`

### Autonomous Mutation
- summary: `Autonomous code mutation remains blocked for this seam.`
- eligible: `False`
- state: `blocked`
- reason: `Decision state is `wait`, so autonomous code mutation stays blocked. Recommended action is `wait`, not `targeted_mutation`.`
- execution_mode: `candidate_workspace_only`
- auto_publish: `False`
- silent_rollback: `False`

## External Review
- status: `reviewed`
- trigger_reason: `repeated_audit_blocked`
- reviewer: `heuristic`
- summary: `After 787 candidates, the lab requested peer review because `repeated_audit_blocked` fired. Current policy mode is `stabilize`.`
- lab advice: `Bias the next branch toward under-explored backend fingerprints or mechanisms instead of repeating the current local basin.`
- human advice: `Consider strengthening the non-self-evolving seed around `boundary_transfer_regression` if that failure mode keeps dominating.`
- human advice: `Consider exposing `science_loss` as a more explicit evolvable backend module if it keeps dominating search.`

## What The Lab Wants
- summary: `The lab has 4 ranked requests for human help.`
- [12] `evaluation`: `Improve transfer-stability evaluation or smoke tests so promising candidates fail earlier before full audit.`
- [10] `module_surface`: `Consider exposing `science_loss` as a more explicit evolvable backend module if it keeps dominating search.`
- [10] `non_self_evolving`: `Consider strengthening the non-self-evolving seed around `boundary_transfer_regression` if that failure mode keeps dominating.`
- [5] `vram_headroom`: `Consider increasing batch size or model capacity so the science backend uses more of the available VRAM.`
