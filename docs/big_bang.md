## Hindsight
- summary: `The lab saw 9 audit-blocked outcomes; it should have emphasized transfer-stability checks earlier.`
- adjustment: `Raise priority for proposals that directly target transfer stability after an audit_blocked result.`

## Policy
- summary: `Raise priority for proposals that directly target transfer stability after an audit_blocked result.`
- selection_mode: `stabilize`
- cooldown_multiplier: `2.0`
- preferred_runner_backend: `command`
- publish_every_cycles: `1`
- novelty_cycle_priority: `high`

## Budget
- summary: `Mechanisms initial_harness, budget_policy_changed, fusion_changed exhausted their follow-up budget; broaden the search.`
- exploration_mode: `force_broad_exploration`
- tracked_mechanisms: `8`

## Backend
- summary: `The repo-native science backend is available through the command runner with a realistic wall-clock training budget.`
- preferred_backend: `command`
- available_backends: `command, simulated`
- command_backend_configured: `True`

## External Review
- status: `idle`
- trigger_reason: `-`
- reviewer: `none`
- summary: `No external review yet.`
- lab advice: `No live external advice.`
- human advice: `No human-facing advice.`

## What The Lab Wants
- summary: `The lab has 3 ranked requests for human help.`
- [12] `evaluation`: `Improve transfer-stability evaluation or smoke tests so promising candidates fail earlier before full audit.`
- [9] `ops`: `Harden backend startup and completion reporting so stalled candidates stop consuming full budget.`
- [7] `dataset`: `Consider improving the validation split or transfer-oriented data slices so the lab can distinguish local wins from robust gains sooner.`

## What We Did
- summary: `The humans recently addressed 3 lab request(s).`
- `dataset` addressed by `3b11024`: `Added named stratified evaluation slices so prepared datasets can separate benchmark, smoke, and audit behavior more clearly.`
- `ops` addressed by `a3c7559`: `Hardened backend startup and no-progress detection so stuck candidates are cut off earlier.`
- `evaluation` addressed by `930a088`: `Implemented a transfer-stability smoke gate before full audit.`

## Diversity
- summary: `The lab has stayed on `initial_harness` for 6 recent candidates; inject a novelty step.`
- current_mechanism_streak: `6`
- novelty_step_recommended: `True`
