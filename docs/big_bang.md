## Hindsight
- summary: `The lab saw 58 audit-blocked outcomes; it should have emphasized transfer-stability checks earlier.`
- adjustment: `Raise priority for proposals that directly target transfer stability after an audit_blocked result.`

## Policy
- summary: `Raise priority for proposals that directly target transfer stability after an audit_blocked result.`
- selection_mode: `stabilize`
- cooldown_multiplier: `2.0`
- preferred_runner_backend: `command`
- publish_every_cycles: `1`
- novelty_cycle_priority: `high`

## Budget
- summary: `Mechanisms initial_harness, budget_policy_changed, fusion_changed exhausted their follow-up budget; broaden the search.`
- exploration_mode: `force_broad_exploration`
- tracked_mechanisms: `8`

## Backend
- summary: `The repo-native science backend is available through the command runner with a realistic wall-clock training budget.`
- preferred_backend: `command`
- available_backends: `command, simulated`
- command_backend_configured: `True`

## External Review
- status: `cooldown`
- trigger_reason: `repeated_audit_blocked`
- reviewer: `heuristic`
- summary: `After 134 candidates, the lab requested peer review because `repeated_audit_blocked` fired. Current policy mode is `stabilize`.`
- lab advice: `Bias the next branch toward under-explored backend fingerprints or mechanisms instead of repeating the current local basin.`
- human advice: `Consider strengthening the non-self-evolving seed around `science_backend_error` if that failure mode keeps dominating.`
- human advice: `Consider exposing `initial_harness` as a more explicit evolvable backend module if it keeps dominating search.`

## What The Lab Wants
- summary: `The lab has 5 ranked requests for human help.`
- [12] `evaluation`: `Improve transfer-stability evaluation or smoke tests so promising candidates fail earlier before full audit.`
- [10] `module_surface`: `Consider exposing `initial_harness` as a more explicit evolvable backend module if it keeps dominating search.`
- [10] `non_self_evolving`: `Consider strengthening the non-self-evolving seed around `science_backend_error` if that failure mode keeps dominating.`
- [9] `ops`: `Harden backend startup and completion reporting so stalled candidates stop consuming full budget.`
- [7] `dataset`: `Consider improving the validation split or transfer-oriented data slices so the lab can distinguish local wins from robust gains sooner.`

## What We Did
- summary: `The humans recently addressed 1 lab request(s).`
- `seed_backend` addressed by `61b6720`: `Split the seed backend into more explicit evolvable modules so the lab can steer model, loss, eval, and config changes more precisely.`

## Diversity
- summary: `The lab has stayed on `initial_harness` for 6 recent candidates; inject a novelty step.`
- current_mechanism_streak: `6`
- novelty_step_recommended: `True`
